The output of the aes.c program matches the expected output. 
This indicates that the AES implementation is correct.

One possible addition to this AES implementation is to integrate integrity checks.
This can be done by computing the SHA-256 hash of the plaintext and including it
as a header of the plaintext before encrypting the entire message. 
The receiver can then compute the SHA-256 hash of
the decrypted plaintext without the header and compare it to the included hash header.
If the hashes match, the integrity of the message is verified.
