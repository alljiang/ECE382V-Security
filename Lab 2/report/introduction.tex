In this lab, we implement AES-256 and RSA encryption and decryption in C. 
The goal of  this lab is to familiarize ourselves with implementing cryptography algorithms.

We are using CTR block cipher mode for AES-256 encryption and decryption.
The S-box is provided for us, along with a generated key and IV.
